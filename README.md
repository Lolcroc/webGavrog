webGavrog
=========

Generation, analysis and visualization of reticular ornaments using Gavrog, now coming to a browser near you.

The most recent stable version can be found at http://gavrog.org/webGavrog.

To play with the source code:

    git clone https://github.com/odf/webGavrog.git
    npm install
    npm run build-dev

Then open the file `public/index.html` in the browser.

If that does not work, try starting a local web server on the `public` directory, e.g.

    (cd public && python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000)

Then use the URL `localhost:8000` in the browser.
